    </header>
    <p>I have recently started working in Laravel 4.2 and I must say it is really well <a href="http://laravel.com/docs">documented</a>. At <a href="http://ssidecisions.com">Strategic Systems International</a>, currently I am a part of the team working at a Large scale Health Care System built on top of Laravel.</p>
<p>Today, I faced an issue in which some wasn't working as required. I looked through the code and sooner, I found out that the problem was due to some unnecessary hidden field that was being submitted along with the form when saving the data. <code>Input</code> class was being used throughout the action of controller. Now, I had to reset this unnessary hidden field from the <code>Input</code>. Now there were several ways to do so. First option was to reset this hidden field value through Javascript before form submission, but JS might be turned off in userâ€™s browser. Other option was to handle this in the action (function) that was handling the saving process. At first, I thought to do it this way:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">// Get all the form data except the hidden field
$data = Input::except('foobar')
// Now use $data instead of Input
</code></pre>
<p>Considering the size of that action that was handling the saving process, sooner I realized that it would be a bad bad idea to adopt this approach. </p>
<p>I headed to the <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/requests">Laravel docs for <code>Input</code></a> but strangely there was nothing that I could find regarding resetting values from the <code>Input</code>. I searched through the google and finally found it in the <a href="http://three.laravel.com/docs/input">Laravel 3 docs</a>. Here is how I implemented this:</p>
<pre><code class="php language-php">// Merge the Input array with my custom array.
Input::merge(array( 'foobar' =&gt; null ));
</code></pre>
<p>and that did the trick.</p>
